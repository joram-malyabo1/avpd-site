    "history_text": "Actions de Volontaires pour la Paix et le Développement, AVPD for short, is a non-governmental organization founded in 2018 in Nyiragongo, Democratic Republic of Congo, by a group of young people and women determined to respond to the consequences of armed conflict, poverty, and social inclusion in their community. Faced with increasing violence, the despair of lost youth, and persistent inequalities, we decided to join forces to build a platform for non-violent action, awareness, and development. Since its creation, AVPD has carried out projects to promote peace, train young people and women in income-generating activities, reintegrate internally displaced persons, and mobilize communities for social cohesion and sustainable development. The organization works in partnership with local structures and wishes to work with international structures to reach the most vulnerable groups."
